[JMetro](https://github.com/JFXtras/jfxtras-styles) is a JavaFX theme that can be used to give applications a different look and feel.

This code was ported to Kotlin and some bugs was fixed to work on latest versions of [JavaFX](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx)
and [ControlsFX](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx).
